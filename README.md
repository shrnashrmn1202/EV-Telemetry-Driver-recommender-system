# EV-Telemetry-system
A Recommender &amp; Telemetry system for improvement of Electric Vehicle and driverâ€™s performance analysis for the Formula Student event. The project was set-up to help the racing team at Brunel University London https://www.brunelracing.com/formula-student-electric/ in car's and driver's analysis by developing a data acquisition system (currently using Bosch C60 data logging system). A reliable DAQ system and monitoring system is proposed to the team as a useful tool for vehicle analysing and improvement. The sensors are:
1. Temperature - Tyre temperature & Battery temperature of EV
2. Ultrasonic - Suspension of car
3. GPS - Speed and position of car on track
4. Accelerometer - Acceleration of car
